## My Tasks
1. **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Tasks accomplished
* Added title to website
* Removed all "div" elements and added semantic elements 
* Added "nav", "figure", "section", and "main" elements to replace "div"
* Added alt titles to every image
*Removed classes in the html file to make CSS less complicated, and put things into sections.
